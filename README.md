## Project Motivation

The current messaging landscape faces challenges regarding user privacy and data control, as most platforms are centralized, allowing potential abuse of user data and third-party surveillance. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to build a messaging platform that offers privacy, data integrity, and decentralized control. The decentralized nature of the application ensures that only intended recipients have access to messages, enhancing privacy and user autonomy.

## Objectives

1. **Secure Messaging**: Develop a secure and decentralized communication platform leveraging blockchain wallets for identity verification.
2. **Gas Fee Optimization**: Research and implement methods for reducing the gas costs associated with using the Ethereum blockchain, based on the work by C. Li, _"Gas Estimation and Optimization for Smart Contracts on Ethereum"_.
3. **User-Friendly Experience**: Provide a straightforward user interface that integrates wallet authentication and blockchain messaging seamlessly.

## Architecture

The project architecture comprises:

- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the decentralized messaging system. It uses React and Next.js frameworks for the front-end implementation.
- **Backend and Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. Thirdweb SDK is used to simplify contract deployment and wallet connections.
- **Wallet-Based Authentication**: Using thirdweb for integration with popular wallets like MetaMask, ensuring secure, private, and convenient access.

## Features

- **Identity Verification**: Using blockchain wallets for verifying user identities, leveraging the security benefits of PKI.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Messaging**: Ensuring message content is accessible only to the intended recipient by using asymmetric encryption techniques.
- **Gas Optimization Strategies**: To make the platform cost-effective, gas optimization techniques are researched and implemented, focusing on reducing fees for smart contract interactions.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible blockchain (Polygon or Ethereum mainnet).
- **Thirdweb SDK**: For smart contract deployment, wallet connections, and easier integration.
- **React & Next.js**: For the user-facing interface.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Crypto Wallets**: Integration with MetaMask and other Ethereum wallets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/decentralized-messaging-app.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd decentralized-messaging-app
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

- **Connect Wallet**: Click on "Connect Wallet" to sign in with your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Send Messages**: Use the interface to send a message to another verified wallet address. Messages are encrypted and stored securely on-chain.
- **View Messages**: Receive and decrypt messages using your private key, ensuring end-to-end privacy.

## Future Work

- **Scalability**: Research the use of Layer-2 scaling solutions to make the platform even more cost-effective.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improve the messaging interface and explore mobile compatibility.
- **Off-Chain Messaging**: Consider hybrid solutions to move some interactions off-chain for reduced costs while retaining privacy and security.
